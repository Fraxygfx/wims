Only the first page of the exercise

To install:
Need
https://github.com/srackham/w3c-validator/blob/master/w3c-validator.py
in the directory validation

Launch the script in the directory validation

To use on one module write:
./checkhtmlwims address_of_the_module
with address_of_the_module the address of the module
 from the directory wims/public_html/modules
for example
./checkhtmlwims U1/analysis/oefderint.fr
To use on one zone: must change in the file the variable zone (FIXME)

./checkhtmlwims

The results are in the directory "result".
