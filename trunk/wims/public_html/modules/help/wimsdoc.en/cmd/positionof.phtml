syntax:!positionof [``type''] ``s'' in ``string''
mean:Reports the positions of the object ``s'' in ``string''. <br/>\
  ``type'' can be <span class="tt">char</span>, <span class="tt">word</span>, <span class="tt">item</span> or\
  <span class="tt">line</span>. If it is specified, then the comparison only takes place for\
  corresponding objects of ``string'' which are identical to ``s''. <br/>\
  The output of the command is a list of positions (char, word, item or\
  line, according to the value of ``type'') where ``s'' is found in ``string''. <br/>\
  If ``type'' is missing, then ``s'' is searched in ``string'' as a substring,\
  and the positions reported are character positions.
