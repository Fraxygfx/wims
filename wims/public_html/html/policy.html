<b>wims.unice.fr</b> is the home site of WIMS (WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server).
We freely carry user-submitted documents (light phtml files or wims modules),
giving these documents the benefit
of wims features, subject to the following conditions.
<ol>
 <li>The priority will be given to interactive documents providing
  services to mathematical education and research, at any level and in any
  language: courses, exercises, quizzes, puzzles, recreations, interactive
  proofs, demo of free mathematical softwares or scripts, etc.
  <p>Priority will also be given to documents allowing free distribution.
  <p>A wider range of materials may be accepted at the beginning, but we
  will have to be more selective when our disk space fills up.
  <p>
 <li>Documents submitted to the server must be signed, and must carry a
  valid email address of the author. The copyright of these documents, as
  well as legal responsibilities, belong solely to their authors. The author
  of a document can remove that document at any time.
  <p>
 <li>The following documents will NEVER be carried:
  <ul>
   <li>Documents suspected of trying to attack the server, or those whose
    author is suspected of doing so.
   <li>Documents containing illegal or controversial contents.
   <li>Documents violating copyrights of others.
   <li>Documents containing political propaganda of whatever kind, for
    whatever organisation or association.
  </ul><p>
 <li>If an existing document is found to meet one of the conditions in the
  above clause, it will be immediately removed from the server, and its
  author will be denied further submissions to the server.
  <p>
 <li>We will try out best to conserve user-submitted documents as long as
  they are useful to the mathematical community.
</ol>

This site belongs to the Université de Nice - Sophia Antipolis. The
University has the right to change the policy of the site, remove part of
the documents in it, or close it.

<p>
If you don't agree with the policy of this site, please find another wims site
which might have a different carrying policy, or install a wims system on
your own site.
