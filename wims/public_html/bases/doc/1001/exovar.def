We make more and more uses of computer-generated exercises, ranging from simple Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQ) to sophisticated step-by-step activities.
<p>
Such an exercise may be static, that is, it is a unique question with a unique appearance (and often a unique good solution). But they may also be dynamic, that is, they may contain ramdon parameters that change their look (statement and answer) at each new request.
<p>
We call the latter <em>exercises with variations</em>. They have many advantages over exercises with no variations, but the basic point is that a reliable scoring system can only be based on exercises with variations. On the other hand, special considerations should be taken into the design of an exercise with variations.
<p>
WIMS support variations for all kinds of exercises on it, and WIMS tools for online exercise creation, such as 
!read primitives.phtml 1, tool, module=adm/createxo 
, can be used for writing exercises with variations.
