<p>
The point here is that you often will need to avoid some values within the random range. For example, if you generate a random quadratic polynomial 
!insmath ax^2+bx+c
, you don't want $m_a to be zero, for this is a degenerate case.
<p>
In this case, you can generate two random integers, one from 1 to $m_n, the other randomly takes 1 or -1. And the multiplication of the two gives a random integer in the range [-$m_n ; $m_n] that is always non-zero.
