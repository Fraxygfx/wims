First of all, a random matrix can be generated by placing a random number at each of its coefficients.
<p>
Now except some very special cases (such as 2&times;2 matrix whose coefficients are either 0 or 1), a square random matrix has a very high probability of being invertible. Therefore one can first generate a matrix, test for invertibility, and restart if not.
<p>
Another method is to put special values into the coefficients of the matrix, to make sure that it is invertible. For example, to generate a random 2&times;2 matrix 
!insmath [a,b;c,d]
, one can put odd integers into $m_a and $m_d, and put an even integer into $m_c. In this way, the determinant of the matrix is odd, so it cannot be singular.
