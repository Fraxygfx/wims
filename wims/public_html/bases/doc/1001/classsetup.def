Administratively, students are divided into around 11 groups, one group having up to 40 students.
<p>
One virtual class is created for each student group. The teacher responsible of teaching the WIMS course to this group becomes the supervisor of the virtual class.
<p>
In the virtual class, one worksheet is setup for each week's assignment. Within the 11 groups, 8 have one 90-minute session per week, and 3 have two sessions. Therefore, the worksheet for the latter is longer than that for the former.
<p>
Some of the worksheets set up during year 2000-2001 are publicly accessible on the server, with equivalance translations into English. To see them, just make a search for the words 'unsa 2001' for worksheets in WIMS home page. (Those with MP in their titles are for two sessions, and those with MI are for one session.)
<p>
In order to avoid repetition in workload setting up worksheets, virtual classes corresponding to groups with the same workload are sharing the worksheet space.
<p>
Each worksheet is activated several days before the computer-room sessions. This allows students to practice on the worksheet before the session, however scores can only be registered during the session, and from the designated computer rooms.
<p>
Score severity level of worksheets are set to 2 or 3, and may vary from group to group. The teacher of the group also decides on the weight of each sheet for his/her group, taking into account how the sheets are worked on for the group.
<p>
In one occasion, all the virtual classes are set to using a unique supervisor password. This is very convenient when mutual replacements of teachers take place. This has been abandonned after an incident in which a leak of the password lead to vandalisms to several classes.
