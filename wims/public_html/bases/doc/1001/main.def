In this document, we discuss the educational aspects of incorporating WIMS into teaching. There is also 
!read primitives.phtml 1, help, module=help/main 
 containing general help on how to use WIMS, and an
<a href="http&#58;//perso.netinfo.fr/gekhajofour/wims-book/index.html">illustrated manual</a> (in French) for details of how to use it by teachers.

</b><br/>
The major particularity of WIMS compared to other teaching platforms lies in its capability of serving exercises with variations, and reliably scoring student answers to these exercises. 

!read primitives.phtml 3, link, experience, Experiences 
 show that this feature can be used to provide a novel learning environment that greatly enhances the spontaneousness, initiative and autonomy of students.

</b><br/>
By adding variations into an exercise, it becomes repeatable hence much more useful. In the mean time, scores achieved on an exercise with variations reflect much better student understanding of the method than those on a fixed exercise. However, the design of such exercises requires special considerations. These design considerations will be discussed in this chapter.
