This strategy usually works under systems using client-side interactivity (java applets or javascripts) to test answers, but it will never work under WIMS. For the latter, all the user answer analysis is done on the server. Therefore unless a good answer is supplied, it is impossible to get scores using a fake request.
<p>
Even if some WIMS exercises incorporate java applets or javascripts, these are never used to test user answers. Therefore even for these exercises, the security is intact.
