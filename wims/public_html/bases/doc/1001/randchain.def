One can use several random variables, with later randomizations depending on the values of earlier variables.
<p>
For example, in order to generate the random coefficients $m_a,$m_b of a quadratic polynomial 
!insmath x^2+ax+b
 who always has two real roots, one can first generate a random integer $m_a, say, between -10,10. Then generate a random integer $m_b, say, between 
!insmath a^2/4-10
 and 
!insmath a^2/4-1
. Under OEF format, this can be written as
<pre>
\integer{a=random(1..10)*random(-1,1)}
\integer{b=floor(\a^2/4)-random(1..10)}
</pre>
<p>
(where <tt>floor</tt> is the function returning the beggest integer $m_le its argument. Note also that here we have made a special randomization for $m_a in order to avoid the 
!read primitives.phtml 1, link, degeneration, degenerating 
 value 0.)

Another example is to generate 3 integers AB, BC, CA that DO NOT form the sides of a triangle. To do so, one can first generate two integers AB and BC, say, between 3 and 10. Then the third can be randomly taken beteen AB+BC+2 and AB+BC+10. Under OEF format, this is
<pre>
\integer{AB=random(3..10)}
\integer{BC=random(3..10)}
\integer{CA=random(2..10)+\AB+\BC}
</pre>
