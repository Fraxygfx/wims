Call a WIMS module (exercise, tool, doc, administration)&#58; up to 2 arguments.<ul>
  <li>Argument 1&#58; adress of the module (character strings in the URL
  after <tt>.../wims.cgi?</tt>&nbsp;; but you can also copy
  the entire adress). To insure the correct working of the link, please avoid
  using addresses containing a string
  <tt>cmd=reply</tt> or <tt>cmd=resume</tt>.
  </li><li>Argument 2 (optional)&#58; the text of the link. By default, this text will
  be the title of the called module.
 </li></ul>
 The called module will be brought up in another window of the browser, except for the command <tt>\adm</tt>.
<p>For example, <tt>\exercise{module=U1/analysis/graphder}{this}</tt>
or
<tt>\exercise{http&#58;//wims.cgi?module=U1/analysis/graphder}{this}</tt>
gives 
!read primitives.phtml 1, exercise, module=U1/analysis/graphder, this 
. (Both formulas are OK.)
<p>
<tt>\tool{module=tool/algebra/factor}</tt>
gives 
!read primitives.phtml 2, tool, module=tool/algebra/factor 
.
<p>
<tt>\help{module=help/main}{this help window}</tt>
opens 
!read primitives.phtml 3, help, module=help/main, this help window 
.
<p>
<b>Remark</b>. For a document within a virtual class, if you write
<tt>\exercise{3/2}</tt>, it is the second exercise of worksheet 3 that will popup, with the usual user scoring system.
<p>
However, this is limited to exercises without score dependencies, and you should make sure that the exercise you refer to is really accessible by the readers.
