Insert popup tool forms of WIMS. Variable number of arguments.
<p>
Each argument must be the exact address of a form. (To find the address of forms, make a search of such forms in the home page of WIMS.
Then the address of each form can be found in the source of the returned page.)
<p>
For example,
<tt>\calcform{calcu/int,alg/factor}</tt> gives the following result.
<p>

!read primitives.phtml 1, calcform, calcu/int,alg/factor
