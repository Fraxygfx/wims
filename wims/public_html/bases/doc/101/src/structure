<p>
A document is composed of one or several <em>blocks</em>. A block correspond roughly to a html page, but it is also possible to insert one or more blocks into another.
<p>
Each block must have a name (a unique word) and a title. The entry point of the document is a block under tha name <tt>main</tt>. It is this block which leads the readers to the entire content of the document.
<p>
To create a new block (except the entrance block <tt>main</tt>), you should first cite it in an existing block. When you read the latter, the citation becomes a link that leads you to the creation of the new block.
<p>
There are three wayt for a block to cite another one.<ol>
<li>By a link. \link{link,The syntax of link}
is very simple: it is enough to give the name of the cited block.
One may also use links to cite blocks of other documents.
</li><li>As a foldable part f the citing block. This part may be folded in and out as the readers wish.
 \link{fold,The syntax}.
</li><li>As a transparently inserted part of the citing block.
\link{embed, The syntax}.
</li></ol>
