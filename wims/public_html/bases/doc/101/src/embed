 Insert another block: up to 2 arguments.<ul>
  <li>Argument 1: name of the block to insert.
  </li><li>Argument 2 (optional): a text to replace the title of the cited block.
 </li></ul>
For example, <tt>\\embed{embedded}</tt> insert the bloc <tt>embedded</tt> 
into the current block.

The same block can be inserted into several blocks,
or to different places of a same block. But one cannot insert a block of
another document.
<p>
One can also insert the block of a public document. In this case, the 
first argument 
is the address of the document and 
the third argument is the name of the block to insert  (for the moment,
 the second one is not useful in this case) :
for instance, <tt>\\embed{H2/algebra/docrelatif}{}{block=abscisse}</tt>

\embed{H2/algebra/docrelatif}{}{block=abscisse}
