WIMS allows 
!read primitives.phtml 1, link, security, secured 
 execution of many different softwares via its web interface.
<p>
Various computational tools on WIMS allow the user to access the computing power of the backend softwares in a very user-friendly way, without the need to learn the softwares' command syntaxes. Several softwares may even to chain-executed to increase the power of the tools.
<p>
These softwares can also be used to generate 
!read primitives.phtml 2, link, exercises, exercises 
 with sophisticated random variations,
and/or to analyze replies to these exercises, putting a high level of intelligence into them.
<p>
Even online documents and forum messages can make use of these softwares to embed computations into them.
<p>
A large number of the best open-source mathematics softwares are currently available behind WIMS, including PARI/GP, Maxima, GAP, Macaulay 2, Octave, gnuplot, Povray, etc.
