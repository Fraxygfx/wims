Mathematical symbols and formulas can be rendered using very tolerant syntaxes&#58; pratically any unambiguously recognizable formula can be rendered correctly. Whether in programmed exercises and tools, or in online-written documents and forum messages, it suffices to write, for example, <tt>&#92;(pi(x+y)/(x^2+y^2))</tt> in order to get

!insmath pi(x+y)/(x^2+y^2)
. Or <tt>&#92;([1,2,3;4,5,6])</tt> for

!insmath [1,2,3;4,5,6]
, or <tt>&#92;(integrate(sin^2(2pix))dx)</tt> 
for 
!insmath integrate(sin^2(2pix))dx
.
<p>
These intelligent renderings are generated on the fly, so that any formula can change according to user input, or to the random variation of the context.
<p>
The same is true for graphics&#58; besides the fact that dynamic graphics are omnipresent in WIMS-hosted activities, randomly varying drawings, plottings and animations can be inserted into documents and forum messages.
<p>
For example,
<a href=http&#58;//wims.unice.fr/~xiao/gallery/>this gallery</a> of animated algebraic surfaces is entirely created using the WIMS tool 
!read primitives.phtml 1, tool, module=tool/geometry/polyray 
.
