Practically all the ressources on WIMS can be developed entirely online, through its web interface&#58; documents, exercises, tools, etc. Under the development interfaces, developers can test and debug their ressources online. And online developed ressources can incorporate dynamic 
!read primitives.phtml 1, link, rendering, mathematics formulas&#44; graphics and animations 
.

Management of the installation, from forums and virtual classes to the site management, can also be done online.
