Besides the classical feature of student/teacher authentifications, the main particularity of virtual classes under WIMS is that the work and progress of students can be evaluated via real-time scores in a highly reliable way, based on 
!read primitives.phtml 1, link, exercises, exercises with random variations 
. 
!read primitives.phtml 2, link, 1001/experience, Our large-scale experiences 
 show that the system is able to check every student cheating attempt, except the fact that the server cannot verify the physical presence of the (true) student before his/her screen.
