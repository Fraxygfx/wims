WIMS' search engine and als
===========================

WIMS' search engine works in two stages:

1) A series of scripts create a set of auxiliary files (generally
stored in ~/public_html/bases/sys/, see description further down) and
a list of "keywords" (stored in ~/public_html/bases/site/).

(the scripts must be run in the order given here, as some files
created on earlier stages are used in subsequent stages). In general
the whole process is run by the script ~/bin/mkindex.

- the perl program ~/public_html/bases/sys/mkwgrp.pl reads the INDEX
  files of all the modules on the site and generates 

  - keywords (in format .json) to be used for completion in the search
    engine)
  - the files in wgrp

  (using the keywords and keywords_lang in the INDEX files, according
  to this rule: taking keywords_$lang if it exists, or keywords
  (whatever it is a $lang-module or not).

  Some files are created in keywords as keywords/algebra.fr.tmp, but
  not used for the moment. The keywords in these "keywords file" are
  exactly those in the variable keywords (or keywords_$lang if it
  exists), doing it with the following rules: taking keywords_$lang if
  it exists, or keywords (whatever it is a $lang-module or not).

- the programm ~/public_html/bases/sys/mkdomain.pl creates the lists
  of domains from the graph in domain/domain with its translations
  (domain/domain.$lang) and in json format (english) to be used for
  completion in modtool properties
 
- the program ~/public_html/bases/sys/modindclass.pl creates the lists
  of keywords coming from the example classes in
  ~/public_html/bases/sys/class as well as the files author,
  description, language, level, title (no ranking is done).
 
- the program "modind" reads 

  -- the INDEX files of all the modules on the site 
  -- the auxiliary files in ~/public_html/bases/sys/ (see description
     below)

  and produces keywords lists stored in ~wims/public_html/bases/site :
  they contains the words (or words groups) coming from the variable
  keywords of the INDEX but also words of the title, description
  (deleting small words).

  "modind" creates as well a serial list of all the modules available
  on the site, see ~/public_html/bases/site/serial, and calculates the
  ranking of the site's modules. The modules are classified according
  to their types: A=all (except sheet and classes), D=document, O=OEF,
  X=exercise, T= tool, R=recreation, M= data module.

  To do that, "modind" uses some dictionnaries as
  suffix.$search_lang. --> MC I would simply say uses most of the files in
  ~/public_html/bases/sys/, e.g. wgrp

  -- separately "modind" reads also the files in
  ~/public_html/bases/sys/sheet and do the same type of works

2) The script ~/public_html/modules/home/search.proc (called by the
"Search" form) reads the lists above, do the actual search in such
lists and displays the modules found. It reads also the files of
~/public_html/bases/sys/class and ~/public_html/bases/sys/sheets

In both stages files in this directory (see comments
below)(suffix.$lang for example, but see upper remark) are used to
process the keywords present in the modules' INDEX files.  Each
"search language" has its own series of files.

?? For any module, in any language, the keywords

The contents of these files should be checked by developers and
translators, to improve the behaviour of the search engine.

The files in this directory are automatically generated (on install)
by the corresponding ".src" file in the "src" subdirectory. 

If any of the files described below is omitted, then the corresponding
feature in the corresponding language is disabled. E.g. the files
words.fr/words.fr.src and suffix.fr/suffix.fr.src will be/have been
deleted in order to make the search engine correctly working.

  (Remark : I delete the files words.fr.src and suffix.fr.src by
  renaming If any of the files described below is omitted, then the
  corresponding for the moment xx_orig, so they are not used, but on a
  public servor, feature in the corresponding language is
  disabled. E.g. the files the files suffix.fr.src must be deleted by
  hand.

  Rmk : (bpr) I deliberately delete the suffix.fr as it is
  incompatible with a list of words shown by completion (for example,
  loi normale was translated in loi norm??, I do not remember, it is
  impossible to write such things to completion, and loi normale was
  not found).  suffix.en should be also deleted.


, will be done by the script in the stable release if we are OK)

Syntax: the lines for most of these files are in the form

==
givenword:substitute
==

=============================================================

Files
=====

words.$search_lang : correct misprints in the search words
(used both by "mkindex" and "search.proc"). 

E.g. if the file words.en contains the line

==
analytical:analytic
==

then the word "analytical" is considered a misprint and any occurrence
of the string "analytical" is replaced in the search by the string
"analytic" (for the language "en")

Note: words.fr was deleted because it caused the search engine not to
work properly. The site manager can reactivate the functionality by
adding the file again (?? how to get the "original" files from the
svn?).

Note: the file words.en is used by the module tool/wcalc.en (see
~/public_html/modules/tool/wcalc.en/dic )

=====================

suffix.$search_lang : process common suffixes in the search words
(used both by "mkindex" and "search.proc"). 

E.g. if the file suffix.en contains the line

==
ertem:meter
==

then any word ending in "metre" ("ertem" the other way round) is
substituted by the corresponding one ending in "meter" (kilometre -->
kilometer)

Note: suffix.fr was deleted because it caused the search engine/the
keyword completion not to work properly. The site manager can
reactivate the functionality by adding the file again.

=====================

wgrp/wgrp.$search_lang : groups of word
(these files are automatically generated, and used by "mkindex")

E.g. if the file wgrp/wgrp.en contains the line

==
affine geometry:affine geometry,
==

then the search matches for the group of words "affine geometry" as a
whole: if the the user searches for "affine geometry" the search
engine returns only the modules containing as keyword the exact string
"affine geometry" (if such line were not present the search engine
would return both the modules containing the word "affine" and the
modules containing the word "geometry").

The "wgrp" files are now generated from the modules' keywords by the
script ~/public_html/bases/sys/mkwgrp.pl : whenever a module contains
multiple words keywords, such keywords are added to the wgrp files. 

E.g. tool/algebra/smallgroup.fr/INDEX contains the keyword 

keywords=group, finite group, order, subgroup, conjugacy class, center, normal subgroup, subgroup lattice

so for each of the groups of words between two commas the
corresponding groups of words are created

finite group
conjugacy class
normal subgroup
subgroup lattice

(in the corresponding language file)

NOTE: problems when the strings contains the apostrophe "'"
(e.g. "algorithme d'euclide")

=====================

indignore.$search_lang : ignored words
(used by "mkindex")

All the words listed in the file are ignored by the search engine. 

=====================

abuse.$search_lang : swearwords to be ignored by the search engine
(used by ??)

=====================

andor.$search_lang : conjunctions ("and", "or") to be ignored by the 
search engine

The file andor.xx is mentioned in src/insmath.c (processing logic
statements in math formulas) but this is for the moment used by no
modules (to be used, one must have insmath_logic=yes which do not
exist in any public module as I know).


=====================

keywords.fr : ??
(used by ??) should be deleted

=======================================================


Some indexing examples
======================

U1/algebra/vecshoot.en

As this is an exercise module it is indexed in the lists A.$lang (All)
and X.$lang (eXercise).

This is a multilanguage module (main language "en", translation
language "it"). 

The index file contains the following (nonempty) lines

  title=Vector shoot
  description=click on a linear combination of 2D vectors.
  language=en
  category=exercise
  domain=algebra, linear algebra
  level=H4,H5,H6,U1,U2
  keywords=vector, linear combination
  scoring=yes
  copyright=&copy; 1998- (<a href="COPYING">GNU GPL</a>) 2013
  author=XIAO,Gang
  address=xiao@unice.fr
  version=2.20
  wims_version=4.05a
  translation_language=it
  title_it=Colpisci i vettori
  description_it=individuare una combinazione lineare di vettori 2D.
  keywords_it=vettore, combinazione lineare,bersaglio
  translator_it=Anna, Lucci
  translator_address_it=anna.lucci@gmail.it

In stage 1 the module is given a serial number (depending on the
modules actually available on each site, on my site the serial number
is "1003"). As the distribution also includes the modules
U1/algebra/vecshoot.cn (1002) and U1/algebra/vecshoot.fr (1004) that
correspond to translation of this module into "cn" and "fr"
respectively, the A.cn/X.cn and A.fr/X.fr contain no reference to this
module (1003) but contain only reference to the corresponding
translated module (1002 resp 2004). --> HELP there is no A.cn file!!

The files A.en contains the following lines related to this module.

?? (...?2 is the ranking, why do we sometimes have ....?4 )

2d:1003?2                           from description and description_it

				    directive "sr:r" in suffix.en)
vettore:1003?2			    from keywords_it
xiao:1003?2			    from author

The file A.it contains the following lines related to this module.

(NOTE: only difference is that in A.it there is the keyword "vectors",
no difference in keywords, the only difference is in the list of
modules, list that I omitted to clarify this example)

vettore:1003?2
xiao:1003?2

NOTE: title_it is missing from the index: you cannot find the module
by searching for its Italian title

The file A.$lang for languages different from the above contains lines
related to this module.

E.g. A.nl

2d:					
algebraisch:			directive "algebra:algebraisch" in words.nl
bersaglio:			
clicking:			directive "click:clicking" in words.nl
combinaison:			"combination:combinaison" in words.nl
combinazione:

gang:
levelh4:
levelh5:
levelh6:
levelu1:
levelu2:

linearly:			"linear:linearly" in words.nl
niet: 				"on:niet" in words.nl
ofwel:				"of:ofwel"
shooting:			"shoot:shooting"
vector:
vettore:
xiao:

the wgrp groups "linear algebra" and "linear combination" are missing
because of the directive "linear:linearly" in words.nl which is
executed before wgrp (?? check).

note: ?? words.nl contains both the line algebra:algebraisch and
algebraisch:algebra ?? (and more similar pairs)

E.g. A.de

almost the same as A.en except for the lines "vectors" (suffix.en) and
"vector shoot" (WHY??). There is no "wgrp.de" file.

====================================

In popup.fr, I change also the way to use the keywords for analogous
reason, I do not have done it in popup.$lang for $lang != fr).

The file suffix.fr was also used by wcalc.fr , for compatibility
with popup on the external web pages, I keep it (so copy it
in the wcalc.fr modules).

Be careful (MC: I know, I hope it is better now with the example): keywords have two significations here :
  - the perl script takes only the words in  the variable keywords
  (so only them are in the list of completion)
  - modind.c creates files A.$lang etc which are based on words of keywords,
  title, description. They are not all of them in the "completion list"
  but can be written and found by the search engine.
