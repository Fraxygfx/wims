  this variable will be overwritten each time a $emph!exec$emphend
  command is executed.
 $var_lst wims_module_log$emphend0 is used for individual
  module's log files: if this variable is non-empty, wims.cgi will put its
  content into the module's log file, at the end of the process of the
  user request.
 $var_lst wims_version$emphend0 has a value preset to the
  current version of the wims server.
 $var_lst wims_version_date$emphend0 has a value preset to the
  last compile date of the server program.
 $var_lst wims_site_manager$emphend0 contains the electronic address of the 
  site manager, as defined in the configuration file
  $emph wims.conf$emphend of the site. Modules should not modify this
  variable.
 $var_lst wims_print_precision$emphend0 defines the printing precision when a 
  result of evaluation (via <tt>!eval</tt> or <tt>$[...]</tt>) is converted to
  a character string. Default value: $emph$wims_print_precision$emphend
  (may be modified in wims.conf).
 $var_lst wims_warn_$emphend0... is ...
 $var_lst wims_compare_precision$emphend0 is used to define error tolerance
  when wims compares two numerical values. Formula: <tt>!ifval a=b</tt> will
  return TRUE if <center>
  abs(a-b)*$$wims_compare_precision&lt;abs(a+b)+1/$$wims_compare_precision. </center>
  Default value: $emph$wims_compare_precision$emphend (may be modified in wims.conf).
 $var_lst wims_texsize$emphend0 can be used to modify TeX sizes for the
  module. Default value is 0 (no change). Maybe 1,2,... (increase TeX size) or
  -1,-2... (decrease TeX size).
 $var_lst wims_homeref_parm$emphend0 is reserved for future use in the command
  <tt>!homeref</tt>.
 $var_lst wims_homeref_bgcolor$emphend0 is...
 $var_lst wims_rawmath_functions$emphend0 is used to tell rawmath routine that
  the words contained in the variable value should be treated as function names.
  These words can be separated either by white space or by comma.
 $var_lst wims_rawmath_variables$emphend0 is used to tell rawmath routine that
  the words contained in the variable value should be treated as math variable
  names. These words can be separated either by white space or by comma.
 $var_lst wims_ref_name$emphend0  gives the addess of the wims serveur (for this server, $wims_ref_name)
 $var_lst httpd_HTTP_HOST$emphend0 gives the name of the wims serveur (for this server, $httpd_HTTP_HOST)
 $var_lst wims_ref_target$emphend0 defines the target of the command
  <tt>!href, !homeref, !form</tt>. Its value is <b>not</b> automatically 
  reset to empty after the commands. (Defaults to empty string, meaning that
  the target is the current document.)
 $var_lst wims_ref_id$emphend0 defines the id in the command
  <tt>!href</tt> (&lt;a ... id=" "&gt;). Its value is automatically 
  reset to empty after the commands. (Defaults to empty string)
 $var_lst wims_ref_class$emphend0 defines the css class in the command

  pages sent to clients. Don't touch it if you don't know what this means.
 $var_lst module_init_parm$emphend0 is...
$table_end

 $var_lst ins_align$emphend0 defines the manner in which the inline picture
  is aligned with respect to the line. Possible values: bottom, middle or top.
  Default is empty (which means bottom).
 $var_lst ins_attr$emphend0 is used to define miscallaneous attributes of a 
  dynamic insertion. Examples:
  <pre>  ins_attr = align=middle</pre>
  (aligns the middle of the image with the baseline for the current
  textline), or
  <pre>  ins_attr = ismap</pre>
  (coordinates of the click will be passed back to the server; if the link
  of the element is the wims server, the coordinates will be registered
  under the variable $emph no_name$emphend.)
  $resetyes
 $var_lst ins_border$emphend0 is used to define border width of the html
  element $emph IMG $emphend
  resulted from the dynamic insertion. Its value should be a positive 
  number.
  $resetyes
 $var_lst ins_density$emphend0 is used to define the density of the dynamic
  insertions. Default value: $emph 100x100 $emphend.
  <br/>
  <b><font color=red>Avoid using this variable!</font></b> We are planning to

  graphics file of the dynamic insertion: its value should be either $emph
  gif$emphend or $emph jpg$emphend. The default value of this variable is

  wims.conf$emphend; but such change is not recommended). <br/>
  Some types of dynamic insertions may not be affected by this variable.
 $var_lst ins_quality$emphend0 is used to define quality of the graphics
  convertion used in dynamic insertions. Its value should be between 0 and
  100. Affects only dynamic insertions whose graphics format is jpg.
 $var_lst ins_tag$emphend0 is used for dynamic insertions within a form.
  In this case define<br/>
  <tt>ins_tag=form </tt>$emph name$emphend<br/>
  where $emph name$emphend is the name of the html element $emph IMG $emphend
  within the form (optional).
  $resetyes
 $var_lst insdraw_size$emphend0 is the size in pixels for the dynamic insertion.
  $var_lst ins_filename$emphend0 is the name of the graphics file of the dynamic insertion 
  (generated by wims). It must be taken just after the command !insdraw
 $var_lst ins_url$emphend0 is the url of the graphics file of the dynamic insertion.
 It must be taken just after the command !insdraw
 $var_lst insplot_data$emphend0 is ...
 $var_lst insplot_font$emphend0 is ...
 $var_lst insplot_set $emphend0 is ...
 $var_lst insplot_split$emphend0 is ...

  (white is transparent).
