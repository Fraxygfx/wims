  $lst_mean Computes coordinates of points on the level curve of 
  $emph f(x,y)$emphend, at levels $emph l1,l2,...$emphend (defaults to one
  level 0). <p>
  The computation is made from $emph (x1,y1)$emphend to 
  $emph (x2,y2)$emphend, and points are computed as integer positions in a
  picture with size $emph xsize,ysize$emphend. <p>
  Order of the fields is not important. All the fields except levels are 
  mandatory.
