  $lst_mean The server program will call TeX to process the (plain) TeX
  source $emph texsource$emphend (after variable substitution),
  translate the result into a picture, and
  insert it into the page (at the place of the command). <br>
  A tip: avoid using substituted variables in $emph texsource$emphend
  whenever possible. In this case Wims will use static instex, improving
  performance dramatically over dynamic instex. <br>
  The font color of the inserted text can be controled either by the variable
  $emph instex_color$emphend, or by a <tt>\special{color=...}</tt> string
  in the $emph texsource$emphend.
