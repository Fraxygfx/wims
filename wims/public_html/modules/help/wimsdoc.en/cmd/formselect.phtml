  $lst_mean Creates a select menu under a previously defined html form. <br/>
  This command speeds up the creation of select menus, as well as simplifies
  the source files. In the parameters, $emph name$emphend defines the
  name field of the menu, and the values of the menu are either integers
  going from $emph n1$emphend to $emph n2$emphend (in the first syntax), or 
  items in the list $emph selectlist$emphend. <br/>
  The optional parameter $emph promptlist$emphend can be used to generate
  user prompts for each items in the list. If $emph promptlist$emphend is
  empty or is shorter than $emph selectlist$emphend, the undefined prompts
  will be replaced by the value. If it is longer, the rest will be ignored.
  <br/>
  The default of the menu will be the current value of the variable 
  $emph $$name$emphend. <br/>
  The variable $emph wims_formselect_switch$emphend may be used to set
  switches (for example by letting <span class="tt">wims_formselect_switch=multiple</span>,
  the selection will be multiple.
