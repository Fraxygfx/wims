  $lst_mean Creates a checkbox list menu under a previously defined html form. <br/>
  This command speeds up the creation of checkboxed menus, as well as simplifies
  the source files. In the parameters, $emph name$emphend defines the
  name field of the menu, and the values of the menu are either integers
  going from $emph n1$emphend to $emph n2$emphend (in the first syntax), or
  items in the list $emph selectlist$emphend. <br/>
  The optional parameter $emph promptlist$emphend can be used to generate
  user prompts for each items in the list. If $emph promptlist$emphend is
  empty or is shorter than $emph selectlist$emphend, the undefined prompts
  will be replaced by the value. If it is longer, the rest will be ignored.
  <br/>
  An $emph id$emphend is created automatically, except if the variable
  $emph wims_ref_id$emphend is specified just before. If the variable
  has the values $emph wims_html_mode$emphend has a value as $emph div$emphend,
  $emph li$emphend, $emph td$emphend, the different items of
  the html form will be in the corresponding html environmment. If the
  variable $emph wims_ref_class$emphend is non empty, the class of
  this html environment is the value of this variable.
  The default of the menu will be the current value of the variable
  $emph $$name$emphend.
