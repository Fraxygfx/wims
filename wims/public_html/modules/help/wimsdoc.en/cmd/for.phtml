  $lst_mean For loop. In the first two forms, $emph var $emphend goes from
  $emph start$emphend to $emph end$emphend, with optional step $emph
  st$emphend. <br>
  In the last form, $emph var$emphend takes successively items in the list
  $emph list$emphend. $emph list$emphend is a list of items separated by
  commas. <br>
  The command
  <pre>!break</pre>
  within the for loop breaks it. $emph continue $emphend is not yet
  implemented in this version. <br>
  It is recommended that the variable name $emph var$emphend be added to the 
  <tt>!next </tt> line. This has no effect for the time being, but may be
  used in future versions of wims.
