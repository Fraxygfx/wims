  $(lst_syntax)read $emph file$emphend [$emph parm$emphend]</span>
  $lst_mean Insert the content of $emph file$emphend, and process it.
  $emph file$emphend must be a valid file name with the module's home
  directory as base directory. (directory structure may be specified in $emph 
  file$emphend, but backtracing to parent directories is prohibited.)
  <br/>And the parameter $emph parm$emphend can be accessed from within
  the called $emph file$emphend under the variable name $emph
  wims_read_parm$emphend.
  <br/>
  WIMS will try to cache the file for repeated use, unless the filename
  is preceded by "./".
