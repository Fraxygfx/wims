  $(lst_syntax)random $emph n1$emphend ,$emph n2$emphend</tt>
  $lst_mean Returns a random real number between $emph n1 $emphend and $emph
  n2 $emphend. <br>
  Substitution and evaluation are done on $emph n1 $emphend and $emph n2
  $emphend before applying random. <br>
  If $emph n2 $emphend is missing, returns random number between 0 and
  $emph n1 $emphend. <br>
  If both $emph n1 $emphend and $emph n2 $emphend are missing, returns 0.
  <br>
  You can also type <tt>!random n1,n2 repeat i</tt> to repeatedly generate
  $emph i$emphend random numbers.
