  $(lst_syntax)translate [internal] $emph s1 $emphend to $emph s2 $emphend in $emph
  string$emphend<br>
  </tt>or <tt>!translate [internal] $emph s1$emphend in $emph string$emphend
  to $emph s2$emphend</tt>
  $lst_mean String manipulation: variable substitution is first done on 
  $emph string$emphend. Then all occurences of the first (resp. second, ...)
  character of $emph s1$emphend is replaced by the first (resp. second, ...)
  character of $emph s2$emphend. <br>
  When the keyword $emph internal $emphend is absent,
  the Linux utility $emph tr$emphend is called to make the translations,
  therefore regular expressions are accepted in $emph s1$emphend and 
  $emph s2$emphend. Please refer to the man page of $emph tr$emphend for 
  details. <br>
