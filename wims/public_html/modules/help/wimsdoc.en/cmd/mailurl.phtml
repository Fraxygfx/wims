  $(lst_syntax)mailurl $emph address name ...$emphend</tt>
  $lst_mean Creates a javascript-crypted email interface that is difficult
  for spammer-robot to decrypt.
  <p>
  The first word of the first line in the parameter should be the email
  address.
  <br/>
  The rest of the first line is the recepient name (default to email address).
  <br/>
  The second line and up is the mail subject.
  <p>
  This command calls, in the order of priority, one of the following files:
  <ol>
  <li>"mailurl.proc" in the module directory.
  <li>"mailurl.proc" in the current theme.
  <li>"scripts/mailurl.proc".
  </ol>
  This allows site managers and authors to define different address encryption
  methods.
  <br/>
  Mail addresses are not encrypted when the user is within a virtual class.
  <br/>
  This command collapses some variables beginning with "mailurl_".
