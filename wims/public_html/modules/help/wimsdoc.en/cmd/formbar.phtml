  $lst_mean Creates a bar of radio buttons under a previously defined html form. <br/>
  This bar should be arranged to represent values from small to big. No
  prompt is given to the user, except the indication that left is smaller.
  In the parameters, $emph name$emphend defines the
  name field of the menu, and the values of the menu are either integers
  going from $emph n1$emphend to $emph n2$emphend (in the first syntax), or 
  items in the list $emph selectlist$emphend. <br/>
  The default of the menu will be the current value of the variable 
  $emph $$name$emphend.
