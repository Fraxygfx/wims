  $lst_mean According to the complicatedness of $emph formula $emphend,
  the server will either render it as beautifully as possible using html
  tags, or translate $emph formula $emphend into TeX source then call TeX
  to compile and finally transform the TeX result into a picture. The latter
  is inserted into the page (at the place of the command). <br>
  If the user browser knows mathml, then the $emph formula $emphend is simply
  translated into mathml and sent to the browser.
