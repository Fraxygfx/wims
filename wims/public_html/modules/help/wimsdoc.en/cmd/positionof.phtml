  $(lst_syntax)positionof [$(emph)type$emphend] $emph s $emphend in $emph
  string$emphend</tt>
  $lst_mean Reports the positions of the object $emph s $emphend in 
  $emph string$emphend. <br/>
  $emph type$emphend can be <tt>char</tt>, <tt>word</tt>, <tt>item</tt> or
  <tt>line</tt>. If it is specified, then the comparison only takes place for
  corresponding objects of $emph string$emphend which are identical to 
  $emph s$emphend. <br/>
  The output of the command is a list of positions (char, word, item or
  line, according to the value of $emph type$emphend) where $emph s$emphend
  is found in $emph string$emphend. <br/>
  If $emph type$emphend is missing, then $emph s$emphend is searched in
  $emph string $emphend as a substring, and the positions reported are 
  character positions.
