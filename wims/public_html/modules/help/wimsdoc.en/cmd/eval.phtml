  $(lst_syntax)eval $emph expr$emphend</tt> <br>
  $lst_mean Returns the numerical value of the expression $emph expr$emphend.
  $emph expr $emphend must evaluate to a real number (under the
  current version of wims). The evaluation is internally done in double
  precision, but the print precision can be changed by setting the variable
  $emph wims_print_precision $emphend (whose default value is 8). <br>
  If an error is found in the expression $emph expr$emphend, 0 is returned.
  (I know that this is very bad; I just have no time to make everything right.)
