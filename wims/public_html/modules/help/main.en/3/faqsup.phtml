<ul>
 <p><li><b>Q.</b><i> How should I do to add an exercise to a worksheet?</i> <p>
 <b>A.</b> From the homepage of the class (when you are logged as the
  supervisor), find the desired exercise, then choose the desired
  configuration (level of difficulty, etc.), and go to work on it. At the
  bottom of the working page of the exercise, there is a link called
  `add to a worksheet'. Click on it and follow instructions.
  <p>
  Please notice that the exercise thus added to the worksheet will have
  exactly the configuration you have chosen, when your students work on it.

 <p><li><b>Q.</b><i> Is it possible for a student to change the configuration
  of an exercise fixed by me (supervisor)?</i> <p>
 <b>A.</b> Yes, it is possible. But no score will be registered if it is
  obtained from a reconfigured exercise.

 <p><li><b>Q.</b><i> Can I delete an active worksheet?</i> <p>
 <b>A.</b> No. When a worksheet is activated, it can neither be modified nor
  be deleted. However, you can change its status to <em>expired</em>
  (participants see it but no score will be registered) or <em>expired and
  hidden</em> (participants no longer see it). But the sheet will always
  be visible to you.
  <p>
  We know that this is awkward, and we are studying the possibility of a more
  flexible solution.

 <p><li><b>Q.</b><i> I would like to open score registration of a sheet
  exactly for PC's in a given classroom.</i> <p>
 <b>A.</b> Usually these PC's all have IP addresses with the same starting
  numbers, for example 134.59.102.212, 134.59.102.109, 134.59.102.57, etc.
  In this case you can open score registration for the IP address
  <tt>134.59.102.</tt>, and all the above PC's will get through (together with
  maybe some other machines having the same starting address).

 <p><li><b>Q.</b><i> A participant has forgotten his/her login name or
  password.</i> <p>
 <b>A.</b> From supervisor's home page, click on `list of participants' then
  click on the name of the participant. The login name will show up at the
  head of the page. And at the bottom of the page, there is a link allowing
  you to change his/her password without knowing the old one.
