<h3><center>wims_version of a module</center></h3>

WIMS is a system that evolves rapidly. New features are introduced to 
each new release.
<p>
If a module is developed under a recent version of WIMS, it may not be able
to run under a server of earlier version, because the latter does not have
the features needed to make it work correctly.
<p>
For this reason, WIMS now refuses to execute a module which requires a newer
wims_version.
<p>
As your module $mod is developed under WIMS-$wims_version, it is safe if you
declare it requiring wims_version $wims_version. Unless you are sure that
you haven't used any new feature since an earlier wims_version, in which
case you can use version_cheat. But you are warned that if you make it
wrong, people may start discovering weird "bugs" in your module!
