<h3><center>Addressing convention of WIMS modules</center></h3>

Activity modules should have an address of type
<font color=green><tt>Zone/category/name.lang</tt></font>. 
This is translated to
<font color=green><tt>Zone~category~name.lang</tt></font>
when the module is under development.

<ul>
<p><li>Zone: this is limited to the allowed zones of the system. Among them,
those with a upper-case letter followed by a number are zones corresponding
to academic levels, 
<font color=blue><tt>Lang</tt></font>
corresponds to language-learning materials,
<font color=blue><tt>tool</tt></font>
contains various online tools,
<font color=blue><tt>local</tt></font>
are modules that will only be used on the local server,
<font color=blue><tt>test</tt></font>
is a non-publishable testing zone in which you can put anything you like.

<p><li>category: this could be any word of your choice, but when you submit
the module for publication, it will be accepted only if the category is
known to the system.
<p>
Please look at the categories of existing modules for the possibilities.
In case of doubt, please write to the
!mailurl $sysadmin publication coordinator
.

<p><li>name: any word of your choice, preferably between 4 and 12 lower-case characters.

<p><li>lang: The two-character language code of the module. Must be within the languages
supported by the site ($wims_site_languages), and should be equal to the language defined in the
module's INDEX file.

</ul>
