COMPOSE type exercises require the learner to put words or word groups in order.
If you want to add commas or semicolons use their html code instead 
(&amp;#44; for the comma and  &amp;#59; for the semicolon).

:format
font color=green>
:The cat /is / eating/a mouse.
:Here / is / another example.
:1st word(s)/ 2nd word(s)/ 3rd word(s)/ on/one/line
</font>
<i><font color=black>Remark</font></i> : Preferences for a data set .
If you wish to add a different audio recording, a different title (i.e. text) 
or a different introduction to each data set (i.e. exercise), 
the first line must have the following format

<font color=green>
:audio=name_of_audio_file.mp3 image=name_of_picture _file.jpg title="your text" intro="your instructions" 
</font>
