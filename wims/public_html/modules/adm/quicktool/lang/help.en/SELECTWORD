$wims_name_quick_SELECTWORD requires the learner to select a word or words in a piece of text.

Usually there are two phases in a $wims_name_quick_SELECTWORD type exercise:
In the first phase certain words or group of words have to be identified by clicking on them.
In the second phase the learner has to provide some sort of "explanation" for 
each word or group of words (for example a translation, identification of the 
grammatical form, the irregular form of a verb or a plural noun, etc.).

In the second phase of the exercise: 
<ol><li> 
You can decide which format you wish to use(clickfill, case, dragfill).
If there are several possible correct answers, they have to be separated by ||.
</li>
<li>
The feedback (correct answers) to the exercise can be displayed either 
in the text beside the word(s) or between the lines or outside the text.
</li></ol>

The following variants of an exercise can be created depending on the kind 
of task you wish the learner to do:
<ol><li>
It is possible not to have a second phase (just ask the learner to select 
words or group of words);

</li><li>
It is possible not to have a first phase (i.e. the learner doesn't have to first select words).

</li></ol>


<p>The size of the blanks or labels in the second phase of the exercise have 
to be configured according to the length of the "explanation" required.

<p>
Several data sets can be included in an exercise but they will be displayed randomly .

<p>
A different picture, audio recording, introduction or title (i.e. piece of text) 
can be added to each data set.

<i><font color=black>Remark</font></i>: The possible answers for the second 
phase of the exercise can be added to the beginning of the data file using 
the following format. For example:
<font color=green>
choice=subject,direct object,indirect object
</font>
<i><font color=black>Remark</font></i>: If the exercise has no second phase 
just one ,|is removed and only the word(s) corresponding to the first phase 
shall be written. For example:
<font color=green>
:??The cat?? likes ??mice??. But ??mice??
 don't like ??cats??.
</font>

<i><font color=black>Remark</font></i>: When there are several possible 
correct answers, they have to be separated by || . For example: 

<font color=green>
:She ??be - negative form|is not||isn't?? my sister.
:Elle ??être|était||a été?? aux USA.
</font>
If the exercise has no first phase (i.e. the learner is not required to 
click on a word) the format is the following:
<font color=green>
:??|a possible answer||a second possible answer||a third possible answer??
:The ??|organisation||organization?? of this meeting is difficult.
:Beaucoup de ??|gens||personnes?? en France ont un téléphone portable.
 </font>
 
<i><font color=black>Remark</font></i>: Preferences for a data set.

If you wish to add a different audio recording, a different title (i.e. text) 
or a different introduction to each data set (i.e. exercise), the first line must 
have the following format
<font color=green>
:audio=audio_file.mp3 image=picture_file.jpg title="your text" intro="instructions" 
</font>
