TONIC type exercises require the learner to identify the stressed syllable in a 
word or the stressed word(s) in a sentence. You can either provide a separate 
recording for each word or sentence, or you can provide the same recording for 
all the words and sentences.
The number of data sets and the number of steps can be freely chosen. 
<p>
If you tick the <tt>no</tt> option for random , the words/sentences will be 
displayed in the same order as in the data set.

<p>
The audio files linked to each word in the data file will be used for the sound 
recordings; if the third line is left empty the audio file used by default is 
the audio file whose name corresponds to the word (written without accents and 
without spaces) with <tt>.mp3</tt> for the extension (for example, the sound 
recording for the word "information" is by default the audio file called "information.mp3" 
that has to be transferred into the Modtool account). Tick <tt>no</tt> for audio file.
<p>
In the data file the word or the sentence must be separated into syllables or
parts with the / symbol.(If you separate a word in the sentence , a space is added, 
if you wish to have several spaces between the words, these can be added by using 
the html code for space which is <tt>&amp;nbsp;</tt>

If several audio files are associated with a data set these will be displayed 
together in random order.
