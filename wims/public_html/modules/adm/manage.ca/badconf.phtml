<b>Attention</b><blink>!!!</blink> The file $fname is world readable!
<p>
There is a serious risk that your site manager setup and/or password have
leaked.
Now you MUST change the file attribute of $fname by making them readable only
by the owner,
!if $wims_ismanager=-1
 and make more secure definitions in it whenever possible.
!else
 and define a new manager password.
!endif
<p>
Once you have done this, try this page again.
