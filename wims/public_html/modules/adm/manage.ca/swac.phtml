<p>You may download the mp3 files of some packages of the Shtooka project.
<p>

If you don't, these modules will look for the mp3 of the site http://shtooka.net 

!form reply
 <input type=hidden name=job2 value=add>


!formradio packs list $swac_list
<center> <input type=submit value=OK>
</center>
</form>

It should take some time. If you don't succeed, look at the script 
<tt>
wims/public_html/modules/adm/manage.en/scripts/swac.sh </tt>
and execute it in command line. 
<p>
<small>Because of the fact that the files of wims are encoded iso-latin, it's not
yet possible to use the cyrillic packs.</small>
