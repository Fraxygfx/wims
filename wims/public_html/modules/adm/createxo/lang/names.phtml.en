<b>Note</b>. These models are prepared to allow people to construct rapidly
their exercises. Hence they are often with a simplified and standardised
structure, and do not offer the full power of the OEF syntax. But you can
always put the exercises in raw mode to add more functionalities or modify
them according to your need.
