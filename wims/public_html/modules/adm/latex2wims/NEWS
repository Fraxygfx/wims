2010-02 : Version 3.00
  This module replaces several previously existing language dependent modules adm/latex2wims.xx.
  It has been constructed by localization of these modules, keeping a single 
  computation core and adding dictionaries.

Version 2.1 : 2008-07-30
fix list environment 
add possibility to refer to another document as the "begin" in the "chemin/path"
(useful in a case where we are obliged to cut a document in parts). 
add toc_down
fix a bug in tabular in case there is math inside
fix a bug : % was not neglected if it was before \input 

Version 2.0 : 2008-07-26
Fixed bug : environmentwims did not make asked replacements
Introduced tabular type (with \tablewims{})
Introduced tooltip in toc (require wims 3.64 if active)
