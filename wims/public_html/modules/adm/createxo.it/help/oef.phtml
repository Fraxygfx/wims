<center><h3>The format OEF</h3></center> <p>

OEF means ``online exercise format'', a format for mathematical exercises
destinated to computer-aided teaching systems. The goal of the creation
of this format is to help the exchanges of content between different
systems. Therefore this format only contains mathematical informations of
the exercise.
<p>
The advantage of the OEF format is that exercises under it are very easy
to create. But it should be said that these exercises, in particular those
created by $module_title, are not as performing as native exercises of a
system such as WIMS. It is hard to imagine, at least for the time being,
the WIMS exercises such as Q-Puzzle, the Coincidence series or again the
Shoot series, be transformed into oef format.
<p>
Please refer also to 
!href cmd=help&special_parm=examples the examples
 to have an idea of the structure of an OEF file. <p>
<h4>Basic syntax</h4> <p>
The format of a OEF file is very similar to LaTeX. It is composed of
directives followed by one or more parameters. A directive is a word
preceeded by the character <tt><b><font color=green>\</font></b></tt>,
and the parameters are enclosed in braces.
For example, in the following sentence
<pre>
   \choice{The answer is}{yes}{no}
</pre>
there is a directive named <tt>choice</tt>, 
which has 3 parameters, namely, <tt>The answer is</tt>, <tt>yes</tt>
and <tt>no</tt>.
<p><h4>List of directives</h4> <p>
Here is a brief list of directives recognized by the OEF manager of WIMS.

 for the syntax to define parameters.

$table_hdtr<th>directive<th>number of<br>parameters<th>description
$table_tr<td>title<td align=center>1<td>defines the title of the exercise
$table_tr<td>language<td align=center>1<td>the language of the exercise, such as 
<tt>en</tt> or <tt>fr</tt>
$table_tr<td>author<td align=center>1<td>defines the author of the exercise
$table_tr<td>email<td align=center>1<td>defines the author's email
$table_tr<td>format<td align=center>1<td>format of the statement: see

.
$table_tr<td>precision<td align=center>1<td>precision in comparing user's reply
with the solution. Give a positive integer n here: the comparison will
be done to the precision of 1/n.
$table_tr<td>range<td align=center>1<td>variable range when evaluating a function
supplied by the user. Should be given in the form <tt>n1..n2</tt>, where 
n1 is the start point, n2 is the end point.
<tr>
$table_tr<td>statement<td align=center>1<td>the parameter is the statement of the exercise
$table_tr<td>plot<td align=center>?<td>a dynamic plot. (Still under construction.)
<tr>
$table_tr<td>answer<td align=center>2-5<td>defines a freestyle answer. The first
parameter is the prompt of the answer, and the second is the good answer. 
Such an answer can be tested according to many different types: number,
function, text, etc.

<p>
Optional parameters: <tt>type</tt>, <tt>option</tt>, <tt>weight</tt>.
$table_tr<td>choice<td align=center>3-5<td>defines a multiple choice. The first
parameter is the prompt of the choice, the second the good choice(s), and the
third the other choice(s). The last two parameters may (should) be a
comma-separated list. Multiple good choices are allowed. If a choice appears
in both good and bad choice lists, it will be taken as good.
<p>
Optional parameters: <tt>option</tt>, <tt>weight</tt>.
<p>
Recognized option words: <tt>shuffle</tt>, <tt>noidontknow</tt>.
$table_tr<td>condition<td align=center>2-4<td>defines a special condition for the
evaluation of freestyle answers. See 
!href cmd=help&special_parm=reply help on replies
 for details.
<p>
Optional parameters: <tt>option</tt>, <tt>weight</tt>.
<tr>
$table_tr<td>solution<td align=center>1<td>gives the solution of the exercise with
explanation. The OEF manager may decide on whether to show this explained
solution to the user, according to the user setup of the difficulty level.
$table_tr<td>hint<td align=center>1<td>gives a hint of the exercise. The OEF
manager may decide on whether to show the hint, according to the user setup
of the difficulty level.
$table_tr<td>help<td align=center>1<td>gives a help to the exercise. This help
will always be accessible to the user, in a popup window.
$table_tr<td>feedback<td align=center>2<td>gives a feedback warning to the user
when the answer meeds a specified condition. Usually to warn of a typical
error.
