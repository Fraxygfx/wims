<p>You may download the mp3 files of some packages of the Shtooka project.
<p>
If the modules which call them are intensively used by the wims server, you should do it.
If you don't, these modules will look for the mp3 of the site http://shtooka.net

To download the collections, do it by line command  with the script
<tt>wimshome/bin/swac </tt>. It will install some swac packs at the right space.

<small>Because of the fact that the files of wims are encoded iso-latin, it's not
yet possible to use the cyrillic packs.</small>
