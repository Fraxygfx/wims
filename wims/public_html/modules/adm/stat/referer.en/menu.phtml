In general, a web page who brings many visitors to us is also an interesting 
place for our other visitors. Therefore if you are
looking for web resources related to this server, a list of such pages is
what you need.
<p>
On the other hand, if you are the author of a page containing link(s) to us,
this list allows you to measure the efficiency of your link. It
is also our manner to thank you for the link.
<p>
Our backward link list is dynamically generated, according to the parameters
which you can choose in the following menu.
