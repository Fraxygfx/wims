Addressing convention of WIMS modules

Activity modules should have an address of type
<tt class="wims_fname">Zone/category/name.lang</tt> 
This is translated to
<tt class="wims_fname">Zone~category~name.lang</tt>
when the module is under development.

<ul>
<li>Zone: this is limited to the allowed zones of the system. Among them,
those with a upper-case letter followed by a number are zones corresponding
to academic levels, 
<tt class="wims_fname">Lang</tt>
corresponds to language-learning materials,
<tt class="wims_fname">tool</tt>
contains various online tools,
<tt class="wims_fname">local</tt>
are modules that will only be used on the local server,
<tt class="wims_fname">test</tt>
is a non-publishable testing zone in which you can put anything you like.

</li><li>category: this could be any word of your choice, but when you submit
the module for publication, it will be accepted only if the category is
known to the system.
<p>
Please look at the categories of existing modules for the possibilities.
In case of doubt, please write to the
!mailurl $sysadmin publication coordinator
.

</li><li>name: any word of your choice, preferably between 4 and 12 lower-case characters.

</li><li>lang: The two-character language code of the module. Must be within the languages
supported by the site ($wims_site_languages), and should be equal to the language defined in the
module's INDEX file.
</li></ul>
