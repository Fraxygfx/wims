<h3>Keyword search</h3>
For a list of teaching materials concerning a given theme or level,
choose the <b>resource type</b> the <b>default search language</b> and enter a
<b>keyword</b> or click on the <span class="wims_button disabled">$wims_name_search</span> button.

<h5>Keywords</h5>
You can enter a word such as <tt>graphics</tt> for topic search
or a level name such as <tt>levelU1</tt> to search by level.
The search engine compares these words to the keywords defined by the authors of teaching materials.
<p>
If you enter multiple words, you get the union of all teaching materials associated with each entered word.

<h5>Resource Type</h5> 
The type <tt>$C_A</tt> includes all teaching materials except <tt>$C_P</tt>
and <tt>$C_S</tt><br>
The type <tt>$C_X</tt> includes all exercises, in particular <tt>$C_O</tt><br>
For type <tt>$C_P</tt> you must enter a keyword otherwise no answer is provided.

<h5>Default search language</h5>
The search engine looks for teaching materials in all languages. When a
resource is available in several languages, only one
version is displayed, choosing in priority if possible:
<ol><li> the version of your chosen "default search language"</li>
<li>the english version</li>
<li>one of the languages available for the resource.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Address of a teaching material</h5>
If you already know the address of a WIMS teaching material, as <tt class="wims_address">E4/grammar/oeffonction.fr</tt>,
you may enter it in the search engine.
