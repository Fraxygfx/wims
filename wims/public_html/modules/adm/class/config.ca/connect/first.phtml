Server / platform connection allows your class to directly communicate with
one on another WIMS server or another web e-learning platform. Participants
can transparently navigate between the connected classes.
<p>
In particular, you can mirror this class to a remote WIMS server,
so that if this server becomes momentarily unavailable, work
may continue on the mirror class. Scores on the mirror can be merged later.
<p>
!if $ccnt<1
 This WIMS server has not declared any connectable remote server. In order
 to use this connection feature, the
 <a href="mailto:$wims_site_manager?subject=server connection">site
 manager</a> must declare such remote server, and the remote server must also
 declare this WIMS server as connectable.
 !set basedir=!sh cd ..; pwd
 (The site manager can refer to the file
 <tt>$basedir/log/classes/.connections/myself</tt> for details of how to
 declare site connections.)
 !exit
!endif

Actually, this WIMS server has the following connectable servers.
