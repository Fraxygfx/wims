<center><b>Tuning the score registration.</b> </center>
In the selective open mode, you can make time
restrictions for score registrations, by adding words <tt class="wims_code_words">
&gt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</tt>
 (starting time) and/or
 <tt class="wims_code_words">
&lt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</tt>
 (ending time). These must be in the
 SERVER's local time, and must be separated from other words by white spaces.
 <br>
 Cut times are used to let people take the exam in different sessions. A
 participant having worked on the exam before a cut time will have no access
 after the cut time.
 <br>
 Format of cut times: <tt class="wims_code_words">yyyymmdd.hh:mm</tt> (separate several cut times
 by white spaces).
