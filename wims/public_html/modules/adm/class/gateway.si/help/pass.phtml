<center><h2>Registration password</h2></center>

There are two types of registration password:
<p>
Registration password of the portal is for teacher accounts. This password
should NEVER be given to students, because everybody registering directly
into the portal will be recognized as a teacher and be given teacher's rights.
<p>
Registration password of a class or a course is for student accounts.
Students must register to a given class, but any registation is globally
registered for the whole institution, as a student.
<p>
Only classes and certain courses need registration password, because other
zones (level, program) do not accept student registrations.
<p>
But you can also define or modify the registration password for a level,
which will go down to all the classes and courses of the level as the default
password.
<p>
Leave the field empty when you modify the properties, if you don't want to
change the password.
