This class <em><font color=blue>$nei_description</font></em> 
allows you to share its following resources.

    You are actually sharing them.

   !else
    You cannot share them
    because you are already sharing that of another class.
   !endif
  !else
   You cannot share them
   because you are allowing other classes to share such resources from
   you. Cascaded sharing is not supported. So you must stop allowing these
   shares before you can share from others.
  !endif
 !else
  !if $(me_$(r)cnt)>0 and $r isitemof $nosharelist
   You cannot share them because your own $(name_$r) are not empty.
   Before sharing can be made, you should first
   !href cmd=reply&job=clean clean
   your own resources (if it is possible).

     This will ERASE your own existing $(name_$r)! They will be definitely
