:secure
<b>Secure hosts</b>.
Consider the possibility under which there is a leak of your supervisor
password: when you connect to the class as supervisor within a class room, a
student may look over your shoulder, or even install a keyboard scanning
software to register what you type (including the password). Believe me: if
you keep real scores in your class, the supervisor password becomes a very
coveted object.
<p>
The consequence of such a leak may be catastrophic to the class: data may
be damaged, grades may be modified, or even you may lose your supervisor
access if the student changes your password.
<p>
Definition of secure hosts puts an extra security layer: sensitive
manipulations such as class configuration, password change or score
modificatoin can only be
made from pre-defined <em>secure hosts</em>, when you are sure that students
have no access to these hosts. So even if a student steals your password,
there is not much (s)he can do to the class.
<p>
!read help/hosts.phtml
<p>
By the way, if you have to type your password in a very hostile environment
(such as in the middle of student computers), you should also consider using
one-time passwords (see the password page).
