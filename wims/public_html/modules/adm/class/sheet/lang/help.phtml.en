Score registration

You can make restrictions to score registration, by selecting hosts from which
the tasks can be done or by determining time periods for work by writing the following code  
<span class="tt wims_code_words">
&gt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</span>
(starting time) and/or
<span class="tt wims_code_words">
&lt;yyyymmdd.hh:mm</span>
(ending time).
Time must be the
SERVER's local time and items must be separated by spaces.

For example, <span class="tt wims_code_words">
175.190.50. &gt;20110421.15.15  &lt;20110421.16.15</span>
