 Virtual classes allow teachers to organize the resources on the WIMS site
 (as well as eventually their own creations of exercise) for the work of
 their students, and to have a control on the progress of students.

 If you don't have yet your own class: you may
 !href module=adm/class/regclass click here
 to create one after consulting the
 !href target=wims_help module=help/main&chapter=3 $wims_name_help
, or have a look at the
 !href module=$module&type=example example classes
. <p>
