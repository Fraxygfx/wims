<b>Remarks</b>. <ol>
<li>"Merge" means putting together the activities in two courses.
<li>"Replace" means that the activities in the other cours will replace
that of this one. This will occur only if the former is not empty.
<li>Exam records and non-scoring activities are always merged.
<li>Registration of details of exercises or exams is not transfered.
<li>After the action (merge or replace), the records of the participant
in the other course will be cleaned.
