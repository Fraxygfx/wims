<center><h2>Registration password</h2></center>

There are two types of registration password:
<p>
Registration password of the portal is for teacher accounts. This password
should NEVER be given to students, because everybody registering directly
into the portal will be recognized as a teacher and be given teacher's rights.
<p>
Registration password of a class or a course is for student accounts.
Students must register to a given class, but any registation is globally
registered for the whole institution, as a student.
<p>
Only classes and certain courses need registration password, because other
zones (level, program) do not accept student registrations.
<p>
But you can also define or modify the registration password for a level,
which will go down to all the classes and courses of the level as the default
password.
<p>
Leave the field empty when you modify the properties, if you do not want to
change the password.

<center><h2>Supervisor password</h2></center>

This is used to let teachers to gain management access to the level, class,
program or course. By default, the supervisor password of the parent zone
will be used.
<p>
Leave the field empty when you modify the properties, if you do not want to
change the password.

<center><h2>Options of a program</h2></center>

If a program is <em>mandatory</em>, all students of a class having a course
corresponding to it will be automatically registered to the course. That is,
all its courses are mandatory for the corresponding classes.
<p>
On the other hand, for an <em>optional</em> program, students must
specifically register to its courses. This is useful when the program is an
option.
<p>
If the automatic course installation of the program is set to "yes", a course will
be created for each class of the level at the creation of the program. A
course for the program will also be created when a new class is created in
the level.
<p>
If automatic course installation is set to "no", supervisors of classes must
manually create courses corresponding to the program.

:supervisor
<center><h2>The supervisor of a zone</h2></center>

Each zone (level, class, program, course) of the institutional structure
should have a supervisor. This is usually a teacher, who will be given right
to the management page of the zone.
<p>
By default, the supervisor of the zone is that of the parent zone.
<p>
However, other teachers may also have access to the management page, if they
knows the supervisor password of the zone. The difference is that it is the
"official" supervisor's name and email address that will be shown to the 
participants the zone.
