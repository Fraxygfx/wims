<center><h3>Accepted spreadsheet formats</h3></center>

To upload spreadsheet data to the class, save the data in text format
(either comma-separated or tab-separated), in a file with extension .txt,
.csv, or .tsv. Most spreadsheet programs allow you to save data in such
format.
<p>
Then, put the file name in the `Data file' field, and send it to the WIMS server.
