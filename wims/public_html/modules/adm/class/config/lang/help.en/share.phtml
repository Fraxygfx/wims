<b>Resource sharing between neighboring classes</b>.
<br>
!href cmd=help&special_parm=neighbor Neighboring classes
 can selectively share resources between them.
<p>
Shared resources become identical to all the classes sharing them, including
modifications. That means that if they are modified in one class, all the
other sharing classes will see the same modification.
<p>
For example, a shared message board will show all messages sent from all
sharing classes. And if participant accounts are shared among several
classes, a participant registering into one class will automatically get the
same registration in all the other, and a modification of password will take
effect in all the classes too. The same is true for supervisor account
sharing, but this is
!href cmd=help&special_parm=supshare particularly dangerous
.
<p>
If worksheets or exam sheets are shared, all the sharing classes will have
the same worksheet content and score severity, but worksheet opening informations
are not shared. If the supervisor opens the score registration of
a shared worksheet for his class, score registrations of the same worksheet in
other classes will remain closed.
<p>
Among classes sharing a same type of resources, there must be one
originating the sharing (it is where the resources are physically located).
All the other classes will share this type of resources of the originating
class. Cascaded sharing is not supported.
<p>
It is the responsibility of the originating class to declare classes
!href cmd=help&special_parm=sharable allowed to share
 its resources. Then it is up to the other sharing classes to actually start
or stop the effective share. The originating class has no right to stop an
active sharing (because this would modify the setup of the other class).
<p>
If you want to share resources of another class, the corresponding resources
on your own class must be empty. Due to the fact that many resources cannot
be cleaned due to
!href cmd=help&special_parm=dependencies inter-dependences
 between different types of resources, resource sharings should be installed
only at the setup stage of the classes. In general, once participant
activities have started, many resource sharings are no longer possible.
<p>
On the other hand, a secondary sharing class can
!href cmd=help&special_parm=stopshare stop the sharing
 at any moment. However by the above reason, it may not be able to restart a
stopped sharing.
