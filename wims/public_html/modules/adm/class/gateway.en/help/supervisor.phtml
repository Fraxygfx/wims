<center><h2>The supervisor of a zone</h2></center>

Each zone (level, class, program, course) of the institutional structure
should have a supervisor. This is usually a teacher, who will be given right
to the management page of the zone.
<p>
By default, the supervisor of the zone is that of the parent zone.
<p>
However, other teachers may also have access to the management page, if they
knows the supervisor password of the zone. The difference is that it is the
"official" supervisor's name and email address that will be shown to the 
participants the zone.
