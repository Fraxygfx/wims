<p><center><h3>Sharing resources of another program</h3></center>

Your program is going to share all teaching resources
(exercises, sheets, exams, documents, votes) with the program
<em>$other_description</em> in level <em>$other_level</em>. This means that
any changes to the resources in one program will be automatically reflected
in all the other sharing programs.

<p> <b>WARNING</b>. This experimental operation will erase existing teaching
resources in your program, and is <b>IRREVERSIBLE</b>! You cannot stop the
resource sharing, and resource-sharing programs should not be deleted!

Are you sure you want to continue?
