slib_comment=The output must be used with the command \draw (in first position). \
<ul><li>If <tt>type_histo</tt> is not given, the slib produces an histogram of\
the data values in vector [data] using the intervals characterized by\
[position] : the values of [data] are the areas of the bars of the\
histogram. If [position] is a list of numbers which determine the \
endpoints of  intervals, its length is  1 + length of [data] \
</li><li>If <tt> type_histo</tt> is <tt>baton</tt> ( resp. <tt>stem</tt>), \
the slib produces a  plot of data points in [data] connected \
the horizontal axis by vertical bars (resp. vertical lines) at the \
x-coordinates specified in [position] ; [data] and \
[position] must have the same length.\
</li><li>If <tt>type_histo</tt> is <tt>stem</tt> or <tt>stair</tt>, the slib\
produces a 'stairstep' graph of the data points in [data]. As [position]\
specifies the endpoints of the horizontal lines, its length is  1 +\
length of [data].\
With <tt>stair</tt>, the horizontal lines are not linked together by \
vertical lines.</li></ul>\
<br> If xtics is followed by a number n, there are n graduations. \
If it is followed by a vector, the graduations are on the intervals \
and the text is those given in the vector.
