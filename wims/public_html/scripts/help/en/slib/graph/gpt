slib_out=Generation of a graph without circuit to be used with flydraw when the option word is raw\
or is empty : draw source, \
matrix, matrix of ranks, matrix of positions of the vertex, \
position of points
slib_comment=<tt>s</tt> can be replaced by a matrix corresponding to such a graph (no check is done). \
In such case only 4 parameters are asked.\
<br>The first item of the output is: by default, the flydraw code; \
the address of the generated image if the option word is <tt>url</tt> ; \
the html code for inserting image is already inserted for the option <tt>html</tt>.\
When the option word is <tt>url</tt> or <tt>html</tt>, the two last items are the size of the image.
