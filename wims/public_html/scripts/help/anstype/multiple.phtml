<li><b>Author-controlable multiple choices</b>: <tt>checkbox</tt>,
 <tt>click</tt>, <tt>menu</tt>, <tt>radio</tt>, <tt>mark</tt><br>
 These can be used to replace the standard multiple choice input, giving
 you more control on its appearance. The good answer should contain two
 fields, separated by a semi-colon ``<tt>;</tt>''. The second field (after
 the semi-colon) is the list of choice texts, and the first field is a list
 of numbers of the good choices. In the case of <tt>checkbox</tt>, the user
 must check exactly all the good choices. For all the
 other cases, any good choice will be enough.
 <p>
 For types <tt>checkbox</tt>, <tt>menu</tt> and <tt>radio</tt>, an option
 called <tt>shuffle</tt> can be specified, that has the 
 effect of randomly shuffling the order of items in the multiple choice 
 presented to students.
 <p>
 Automatic shuffle is not applied without the option <tt>shuffle</tt>,
 and the number of choice items is not automatically cut.
 <p>
 And for an opposite effect, the option word <tt>sort</tt> makes the items
 always presented in alphabetic order.
 <p>
 <tt>click</tt> should be used only in the case where there is no other
 replies or choices.
 <p>
 The type <tt>menu</tt> accepts an option <tt>multiple</tt> with value. The
 value of this option gives the maximal size (by default 8) of the choice
 window. For example, <tt>multiple=5</tt> gives a multiple menu window up
 to 5 lines.
 <p>
 <tt>mark</tt> works similarly as <tt>checkbox</tt>, with the difference
 that instead of a button, the chosen item itself will change color. It is
 therefore principally for inline use.
 <p>
 For types where several choices can be entered (<tt>checkbox</tt>,
 <tt>mark</tt>, as well as <tt>menu</tt> with option <tt>multiple</tt>),
 by default the student will be zero score whenever the answer is different
 from the given good answer. If you want to give partial score for partially
 good answers, you can add the option word <tt>split</tt> (synonym:
 <tt>partialscore</tt>. In this case, the partial score will be computed 
 according to the proportion of good answers picked by the student. On the
 other hand, if bad answers are picked, every bad answer will compensate
 two good answers until the score reaches 0. Such a policy is necessary,
 among others, for dissuading people from taking all the available choices
 in case there are many good ones.
 <p>
 While such a formula should fit most of the situations, you can add an
 option word <tt>eqweight</tt> if this is not your case. This word forces
 the computation to be of equal weight both positively and negatively,
 that is, every bad answer compensates only one good answer. But you are
 warned that this seemingly just policy may lead to weird effects!
