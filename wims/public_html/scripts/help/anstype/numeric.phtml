 <b>Number.</b> (name: <tt>numeric</tt>)<br>
 Comparison of real numbers up to the precision defined by the author.
 
If the word <tt>comma</tt> is in the option, real numbers can be written with 
a comma instead of the decimal point (but the good answer must be with a
decimal point). In this case, if the answer is bad, the good answer is written
with the same "decimal point" as the one of the student.
