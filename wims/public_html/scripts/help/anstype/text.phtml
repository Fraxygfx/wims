 <b>Text (case sensitive or non-sensitive).</b>
 (names: <span class="tt">case</span> and <span class="tt">nocase</span>)
 <br/>
 This is a text input to be compared with a given good answer. In the
 case-sensitive type, each word of the input must be exactly the same as
 the corresponding word of the good answer.

 Expressions as  e' are transformed in é (reaccentuation).
If you do not want that, use  option <span class="tt">noreaccent</span>.
