 <b>Click on an image.</b>
 (name: <tt>coord</tt>)
 <br>
 This reply type allows the user to click on an image, and can analyze the
 position of the click according to various zoning criteria.
 <p>
 The good reply must be given in the form of a matrix (row separator:
 semi-colon `;'). The first row is the image URL.
 <p>
 The second row is the position of the criteria for the click coordinates
 to be considered as good. And starting from the eventual third row, each one
 can contain some criteria (bad positions).
 <p>
 The user reply is considered as being good when the conditions in the second
 row are met. Otherwise, if criteria for bad positions exist (third row and
 up), the reply is bad if one of the bad conditions are met; or ambiguous if
 no condition is met (in the latter case the user will be asked to retry).
 If there is no bad position, any answer not meeting the second row will be
 judged as bad.
 <p>
 The number of the first row met by the user reply minus one will be kept 
 in a variable <tt>\result</tt><em>n</em> where <em>n</em> is the number
 of the input field, which can be used in a \feedback.
 <p>
 Available conditions for testing the user click: <ul>
<li><tt>point,x,y</tt> Point at (x,y). It is a ``fat'' point, with
 fixed width.</li>
<li><tt>rectangle,x1,y1,x2,y2</tt> The interior of a rectangle
 with two corners (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).</li>
<li><tt>circle,x,y,d</tt> The interior of a circle with center (x,y)
 and diameter d.</li>
<li><tt>ellipse,x,y,w,h</tt> The interior of an ellipse with 
 center (x,y), width w, and height h.</li>
 <li><tt>polygon,x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...</tt> The interior of a polygon
 generated by the points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), ...</li>
<li><tt>bound,FNAME,x,y</tt> bound defined in the image file FNAME, which
 must be of the same size as the clicked image (but can be a different image).
 The condition is met if (x,y) is in the same fill zone as the user click.</li>
<li><tt>bound,FNAME</tt> as above, but the condition is met if the user click
 has DIFFERENT color than the pixel on the upper-left corner of FNAME.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Several conditions can be combined in a same row, using connectors
 `&' (intersection), `|' (union), `^' (complement), as well as parentheses.
 <p>
 It is recommended that this input field be embedded in the statement. It
 cannot coexist with other input fields, for the obvious reason that any user
 click on the image will send the form.
