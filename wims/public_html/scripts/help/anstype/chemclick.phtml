<b>Click on atoms of a molecule in 2D</b> (require java) (nom : <tt>chemclick</tt>)

A molecule is shown in the applet WIMSChem and it is asked to click on some atoms
or bonds.

This answer type must be used with the command <tt>\embed{}</tt>. 
The first line of the commande <tt>\embed</tt> is the pixels size 
X x Y of the applet. On the second line, there may be some option words (see <tt>chemdraw</tt> type).

The good answer is
 <ul>
 <li>First line. The list of numbers of atomes or/and numbers of bonds as in the file MDMol
 : atoms:1,2 bonds:4,1 .
 <li>Second line. The address of a  file MDMol (extension .mol)  discribing the molecule.
 This file must be in the directory <tt>data</tt> of the module, 
in the directory data of the distribution wims (address <tt>data/xxx</tt>) , in a datamodule
in the directory modules/data de WIMS (in this case, the address is of the form 
datamodule/xxx) or in the module directory <tt>images</tt>  (address <tt>\imagedir/xxx</tt>). 
It is also possible to put the content of the file (with exact MDMol formatage).
</ul>

The atomes will be selected by right click ans are then colored in a different manner.

The variable <tt>\reply</tt>n is them something like  <tt> atoms:1,2 bonds:2</tt>
