(name : <tt>javacurve</tt>)
<br>
This reply type allows the user to draw a line, a polygon, a segment, a
vector,  a rectangle or several points on a drawing.
<p>
The good answer is given as a matrix (row separator:
 semi-colon `;'). The first row is the image URL.
The second row is the condition for testing the user drawing in the following
list:

!set p=anstype.$lang/javacurve
!readproc tabletheme
$table_header
!set caption=!record 1 of help/$p
  <caption>$caption</caption>
  !set header=!record 2 of help/$p
  $table_tr<th>$(header[1])</th><th>$(header[2])</th></tr>
  !set cnt_record=!recordcnt help/$p
  !for u= 3 to $cnt_record
    !set l_=!record $u of help/$p
    $table_tr<td><tt>
!line 1 of $l_
    </tt></td><td>
!line 2 to -1 of $l_
   </td>
  !next
$table_end

<p>
It is recommended that this input field be embedded in the statement. It
 cannot coexist with other input fields, for the obvious reason that any user
 click on the image will send the form.  The size of the image must be written in
 the second argument of <tt>\embed</tt> as <tt>L x H</tt>, 
for example <tt>\embed{reply</tt><em>n</em>, <tt>300 x 400}</tt>.

</p>
En général, the variable
<tt>\reply</tt><em>n</em>, where <em>n</em> is the number
 of the input field, which can be used in a \feedback is 
 the click replies (x1,...)
 except in the following cases : 
<ul><li>
In case of <tt>points</tt>,
 the first line is the list of click coordinates in pixels, 
 the second line is <tt>n1,n2,n3</tt> with
<tt>n1</tt> number of correct points, <tt>n2</tt> number of missing points,
<tt>n3</tt> number of incorrect points.The third line is the list
of numbers of correctly found points. 
</li><li>
in case of <tt>cercle</tt>, the first line is the list
of click coordinates and radius in pixels, the second line
is <tt>n1,n2</tt> with 
<tt>n1</tt> 1 if the center is correct, else 0 and
<tt>n2</tt> 1 if the radius is correct, else 0.
</li>
<li>
in case of <tt>sline</tt>, the first line is the list
of click coordinates in pixels, the second line
is <tt>n1,n2,n3</tt> with
<tt>n1</tt> 1 if the origin is correct, else 0,
<tt>n2</tt> 1 if the direction is correct, else 0,
<tt>n3</tt>1 if the orientation is correct, else 0.
</li>
</ul>
