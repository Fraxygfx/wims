<center>Access restriction definition</center>
<p>

This is multi-line data, executed line by line in their list orders. The
restrictions only affect resource modules, but not administration modules.
Lines starting with a `<tt>#</tt>' are comments.
<p>
Each line is of the format <tt>[access conditions]:[host conditions]</tt>.
<p>
The access conditions is a list of words, which will be ANDed. The available
words are listed in the following table. Each word can be prefixed with
<tt>non</tt> to reverse its logical meaning.
<p>$table_header
$table_tr<th>word</th><th>meaning</th></tr>
$table_tr<td>class</td><td>The connection is within a virtual class.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>com</td><td>The requested module is under the com/ subtree.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>document</td><td>The requested module is a document. (not yet available)</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>exercise</td><td>The requested module is an exercise.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>hint</td><td>The request is for hint.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>local</td><td>The requested module is under the local/ subtree.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>recreation</td><td>The requested module is a recreation.</td></tr>
$table_tr<td>tool</td><td>The requested module is a tool.</td></tr>
$table_end

The host conditions can be any host definition, eventually plus time
definition as for any worksheets. If the first character of the host
conditions is ``<tt>!</tt>'', then the host/time meeting the conditions will
be refused access (for the resources meeting the access conditions).
Otherwise they will be granted access, and subsequent lines in the
restriction definition will be ignored for those meeting the conditions.
