When an answer type ('_name_') is added : 

- create a help file in the directory <tt>public_html/modules/scripts/help/anstype</tt> 
with name <tt>_name_.phtml</tt> 
and eventually in oher language directory anstype.$lang ; in the language
you do not know, create a help file and copy something like
<pre>
!changeto  help/anstype/_name_.phtml
</pre>

- add a line in the file public_html/scripts/help/$lang/reply.phtml in the variable
typelist2 (do it in any $lang/reply.phtml, by default in english to help the translators).
