:First parameter \a.
\real{a=randint(-20..20)}

:Second parameter \b.
\real{b=randint(-20..20)}

:Third parameter \c.
\real{c=randint(-20..20)}

:Fourth parameter \d.
\real{d=randint(-20..20)}

:The computed correct answer.
All common functions are recognized. We use \a, \b, \c, \d to
designate the random parameters defined above.
\real{ans=(\a)*(\d) - (\b)*(\c)}
