:Maximum 10 possible answers will be shown to the learner at a time.
It is recommended that you provide a large number of possible answers for the exercise ,
otherwise the exercise will only show
what is available.
\integer{tot=5}

:The number of correct answers in each exercise must not exceed the total.
\integer{givetrue=2}

:Number of "mandatory" wrong answers.
For example if this number is 2, the first two wrong answers in the list will
always be presented in the generated exercise.
<p> If doubtful, put 0.
\integer{minfalse=0}

Here is a model of multiple choice exercise. The answers are presented in random order.
Change the text here below to make your own multiple choice exercise.
</p>
Select the correct answer.
When there are several correct answers, you can select any of them.
}

:The correct answers - write one per line.
You can write several here (one per line) for random pickup.
Avoid very long sentences! No semi-colons are allowed in the sentence.
$embraced_randitem
\matrix{datatrue=
First correct answer.
Second correct answer.
Third correct answer.
Fourth correct answer.

:The  wrong answers -write one per line.

:Optional words: "checkbox", "split".
Add the word "checkbox" if there are several correct answers and if the student
must seelct all of them (instead of just any one). If you authorise a partial score
for when only part of the correct answers have been selected, enter the word 'split'.
