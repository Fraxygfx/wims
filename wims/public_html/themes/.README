To add a theme:

1. Decide on the name of the theme. If the theme is not intended for
   publication, please put it under the subdirectory "local":
   local/1, local/YourName, etc.

   Say the name is "local/1".

2. Copy the content of public_html/themes/standard to 
   public_html/themes/local/1, and modify.
