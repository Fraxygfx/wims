Starting a "new branche" of SketchEl called WIMSchem.

Because it is likely that some of the functionality and fileformat
will be altered, I've chosen not to relate in terms of "package name" to 
the mother program SketchEl.

Quitting...this is too difficult

5/09/2008

Well, nothing permanent...
A reasonable working compromise...does not yet give feedback.

6/09/2008

Checking now goes fine...
Will try to incorporate in WIMS module and see if there are still problems.

Aplication program only: 
Exporting a single molecule into a Javascript string,
suitable for wims_variable substitution in "dynamic javascript".
Just experimenting with "easy" assembly of a "database of chemicals"
Adding calulation of molmass 

16/09/2008
Added "crippled" Smiles output (as alternative to Brutto-Formula)

The problem of showing/representing the "correct answer" remains troublesome, 
if we want to avoid a huge image database linked to a WIMSchem/SketchEl native format dataset.
[so of every molecule we must produce a name.jpg ...]

Some ideas:
 1) To solve this partially , I've added -very primitive and not always very correct- Smiles output for "correct answer" 
    and "student reply" in function CompareNative(). This is not really usefull for stereochemistry...etc...
    
 2) We can show in the applet the correct answer together with the student reply , 
    just before sending the appletreply to WIMS using AppendMoleculeNative().
    However this can sometimes be a very unclear cluttering of molecules...
    
 3) Another [WIMS] possibility to show the student the correct answers, is ofcourse using the applet as "image" with all params to "no"  
    in the answer.phtml.
    This could mean up to 10 instances of the applet in "my modules".
 4) Automatically produce an image of the molecules with the applet ...? 
    Technically this could be implemented in java/applet. But I see a lot of WIMS trouble.

Corrected number_format trouble in "MoleculeStream.java" on my WinXP installation...
Other Locales can give wrong conversions  [a decimal point into a "decimal comma" ].
Now internal standard "US".
On Linux/FreeBSD no trouble , ofcourse :)

Changed the order of applet-answer, to avoid problems with WIMS and backslashes in LaTeX

18/09/2008
Fixed error in calculating Molecule weights [implicite/explicit Hydrogen]

1/10/2008
Cleaning up a bit...

14/11/2008
Input molecules [the correct molecule as javascript strings] may now also be in MDLMol format.
The MDLMol format is converted to a Native-format string and is used comparing with the student drawing & scoring.
The applet detects Native and MDLMol format: no need to specify.

The application program will now also export a drawing as MDLMol data javascript string.
[Native export to javascript string was already supported]
 
Added support for "file" and "url" loading [both Native and MDMol].
<param name="file" value="file:test.mol">
or
<param name="file" value="file:$wims_home/public_html/modules/H4/mymodule/data/molecule1.mol">
or
<param name="file" value="http://this_server/123.mol"> -->

note: applets can only load files from the originating server.
note: only signed applets can load files from filesystem

15/11/2008
Added param triggered atom menulist.
<param name="atoms" value="H,P,O,C,Zn,S">
<param name="atoms" value="H:P:O:C:Zn:S">
<param name="atoms" value="H;P;O;C;Zn;S">
<param name="atoms" value="H P O C Zn S">
<param name="atoms" value=""> will give default list
No "atoms" param will give default list.

28/11/2008
Added param
<param name="showfile" value="yes">
If set to "YES" or "1" the file given with param <param name="file" value="$wims_refname/etc"> will be shown on startup.
To be used as imageviewer or as question_molecule to be modified by the student ?

If this param is not present or set to anything but 1,yes...
it will load the "file" into the variable "Correct_answer" and it can be used for
comparing of the student drawing withing the applet [using CompareNative()].
 
Note: I did not succeed in compiling the Latest version of SketchEl-1.21 
Even a precompiled SketchEl-1.21.jar did not run on my java version "1.5.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build diablo-1.5.0-b01)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build diablo-1.5.0_07-b01, mixed mode)

However on "Java 1.6.0/07" [WinXP] it runs fine [but I did not try to compile...]

18/12/2008
Improved java version_check mechanism.
Version is now exported as "150" instead of "1.5.0"
Makes parsing in javascript easier.
Note: use javascript example from CheckVersion.java
Tested javascript molecule-string / molecule-url loading on WinXP on several browsers [latest versions]:
[java 1.6.0_6 version]

Browser		URL	JS-String	VERSIONCHECK

Google chrome	OK	OK			OK
Safari		OK	OK [very fast]		OK
Firefox		OK	OK			OK
IExplore	OK	OK			OK
OPERA 9.3	OK	OK [very fast]		OK
OPERA 9.7	OK?	NOK 			NOK [null]
OPERA 10a	OK?	NOK			NOK [null]

It seems that OPERA > 9.3 has some problems with Java-Javascript.
I've added an javascript alert_comment:
"It seems your browser does not support Java - Javascript communication.\n Continue at own risk..."

27/12/2008
Introduced param  <param name="show_hydrogen" value="no"> to trigger the viewing of [carbon] H's
example: CH3-CH2-CH3 -> C-C-C

Introduced param  <param name="show_carbon" value="no"> to trigger the viewing of C's
example: 
CH3-CH2-SH -> -- -- SH

Defaults [or if param not present] for both params are "yes"

28/12/2008
Added param for tailoring the templates. Ofcourse only in the applet.
The standalone application will use the templates from the jar.

If the Applet param is not present or "empty" the templates from the jar will be used.
File format of the template molecules [Native or MDLMol] is autodetected.

example:
<param name="template1" value="$wims_ref_name?session=$session&cmd=getfile&special_parm=1.mol"> 
<param name="template2" value="$wims_ref_name?session=$session&cmd=getfile&special_parm=2.el"> 
... 
<param name="template_n" value="$wims_ref_name?session=$session&cmd=getfile&special_parm=n.mol"> 

29/12/2008
Successfully tested the template-param usage in combination with WIMS !filewrite in the "getfile" directory.
TO DO: make it work for "Native / MDLmol molecules" as javascript-strings. 

29/12/2008
In MoleculeStream.java there was reintroduced one wrong decimal_number_format: 
Producing errors on all Microsoft based browsers.
Now all DecimaFormat's are: DecimalFormat fmt=new DecimalFormat("0.0000",new DecimalFormatSymbols(Locale.US));
 
30/12/2008
Forgotten an extra validity check on param "template" ...
if( parm != null && parm.length()!=0 ){}

Now things like <param name="template1" value=" "> will no longer give a fatal error.
