units-filter (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed a bug which was not detected by the test suite: the written
    output for numbers lesser than 1 was false. Integrated one new test
    in the suite.
  * modified the routine used to round the numbers. As many examples
    made by teachers use integer data, and divisions by 2, rounding
    numbers whose mantissa should be 0.5 is not unfrequent. 
    Unfortunately computations with floats (for example with the
    interpreter of Wims) often yelds unprecise results. This may cause
    troublesome behaviors, when a mantissa which should be 0.5 is actually
    0.4999999999999998 or so. Therefore, the routine used to round numbers
    adds the fraction 1000000001/2000000000 before making a 
    trucation.

  * modified the routine to simplify the output of floating numbers.
  * now the default behavior with the option -o is to display the unit
    given in the input (if it exists).
  * modified the test suite accordingly.

units-filter (2.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified the package to make it non-native, as it can be used
    outside Debian.
  * Added some code to take in account the necessary recoding of some
    units for non-ASCII environments, like UTF-8

units-filter (2.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * added a new feature, to consider physical quantities with a given
    rate of relative precision: syntax <quantity>~percent, to mean a
    physical quantity plus or minus percent % tolerance. The syntax
    <quantity>+-percent% is also allowed, which adds some rentrance.
  * added a new option switch, -l, to have an output in LaTeX language.
