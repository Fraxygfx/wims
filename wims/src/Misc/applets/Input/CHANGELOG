In order to uniform the build of generally used applets :
ant's build.xml build creates:

~/public_html/java/Input/input.jar
and symlink to ~/public_html/java/input.jar (backward compatibility)
and copy test.html to ~/public_html/java/test.html
The Makefile will -also...-- copy the input.jar into ~/public_html/java/Input/input.jar
