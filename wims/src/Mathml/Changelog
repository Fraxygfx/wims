done :
- array row separators "\\" \cr "\tabularnewline" (...) 
- special space "\ " allowed
- Accent replacing by htmlcodes (list is not yet complete...)
- Added "\right." if unbalanced \left( ...
 (preventing errors in mathml)
- added arg --max-mml-size to wims_mathml:
    wims_mathml will now know directly what our max_allowable_buffer_size is
    if the produced XML string is larger it will just send "ERROR"
    mathml() will return 0 ; and wims will do "insmath with gifs"
    note: this is just for a single call to wims_mathml
    note: is your latex is too large, just split it into two or more smaller calls to wims_mathml
    \( latex1 ) \( latex2 ) \( latex3 ) ...  \( latex_n )

- added C-lib headers in wims_mathml.cc to compile on linux (must look into this)

- fixed "empty row" ERROR  in "single collumn array"
    \begin{array}{c} A \\ \\ \\ B \end{array}

- added \bigint \biggint \bigggint without increasing fontsize (that results in loss of horizontal symmetry)
    Drawback (not solved yet...) is that "\left[ \biggint_{0}^{\pi} \right." the "[" will not take the stretched size of "\biggint"
    Incase increase in fontsize, the "[" will stretch...have to see how this works...
 
- transform {\\rm } in \textrm{ } in texmath.c (bpr)
 
- if cal letters do not exist, take the roman one.

- restored converting ">" into "\gt" in wims_mathml.c
  restored converting "<" into "\lt" in wims_mathml.c
- solve f'(x) messing up javacript for clickfill  ( ' -> \' )

- \input{size}{id}{style}{readonly}
    size: 0,999 spaces allowed 
    id:0,999 spaces allowed -> mathml0 .. mathml999 (prefix mathml is hardcoded : reply1 = document.getElementById("mathml"+p);
    style: no "" allowed ; spaces allowed
    readonly : 0,1  spaces allowed(0 = write ; 1=readonly) 
    example : \input{ 5 }{0 }{ color: red;fontcolor:blue;border 1px}{ 1}
- \input added support for hexcolor background-color:#00ff00;
- corrected some flaws with stretchy parenthesis; 
  corrected missing \right. procedure in wims_mathml.cc
    \lpar \rpar usable in createxo for \left( without \right)
    \lbracket \rbracket usable in createxo for \left[ without \right]
    \langle \rangle usable in createxo for \left< without \right>

- improved size & appearance of integral sign \int (larger)
    other sizes are bigint biggint bigggint
    Now parenthesis around integral sign are stretchy
    (),[],{},<> 
    \lpar\rpar , \lbracket\rbracket, \lbrace\rbrace ,\langle\rangle
- added array with vertical separators (will need testing)
- add dfrac ; set dfrac to be 120% of \frac{}{} ...tune in to your favorite value !
    both frac/dfrac are in displaystyle.
- wims_mathml.l : add \Bf as "dialect" for \bf \boldfont
- add \not =, \not=, \not\in, \not \in
- changed lpar/rpar lbracket/rbracket lbrace/rbrace to OTHERDELIM 
- added support for unbalanced \lbracket (etc)
- removed unused code (...)
- removed faulty "
- added \diagup \diagdown
- added \ointclockwise \varointclockwise \sqint \fint"
  more will come
- added extra (non LaTeX) option to \begin{array}{} command.
  now a single  "-" will produce on all rows a "\hline"
  now "-.-.-" will produce a hline under row1,row3,row5
  (the MathML code attribute is:  rowlines="solid none solid none solid")
  The options do not adversely interfere with normal latex (for gif) 
  example:
  \begin{array}{c|c:|c-.-.-.} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array}

- added lots of (probably useless) unicode symbols matching (ams)latex commands.
  added file UNICODE-2-LATEX.txt to be used as "database" for future reference.
  Note: not all commands are integrated in wims_mathml.l (just a random selection...)
  Note: the 'return' is just globally set ; it may need some fine tuning.
  Note: there is a limit to the amount of rules that can be used in wims_mathml.y
  these are defined in "flexdef.h": we should not pass this "JAMSTATE -32766" limit

- add option in wims_mathml to set the fontsize in mathml from wims (via mathml.c)

- add small script to extract latex commands from "wims_mathml" (just for info)

- add option to use zoom on MathML : to test copy mathml.c.ZOOM to mathml.c
    adm/light is adapted to adjusting size and zoom_option
  
- add \size[120]{\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}} to set size sub string in mathml  
  \size[0 - 999]{any tex string you like}
  for now no spaces are allowed in size argument: like in \size[ 123 ]{}
  We must discuss if we can adapt to known LaTex syntax?

- add alternatives just to avoid mathml-errors (...):
    \begin{align*} \begin{dcases} \begin{alignat} \begin{equation} \begin{eqnarray} 
    \emph{} \vphantom
- add { n \choose k } as alternative for \binom{n}{k}
- add \sfrac{1}{3} : 1/3
- add \lmoustache \rmoustache \lgroup \rgroup \Arrowvert \bracevert
- add support for {\rm sin} syntax : \sin \rm{sin} {\rm sin} are equal Roman font 
  In MathML Romanfont RM is <MI mathvariant="norma"></MI> tag
    (all other comon functions like cos,tan,log,etc are <MI></MI>)
    Note: every "word" will be in <MI>word</MI> tags
- added 'value' param to \input 
- \input{size}{id}{style}{value}{readonly}
   
- finished error handling
    wims_mathml.y : All errors will flag ERROR to stdout/stderror.
    Wims will switch to insmath_with gifs...
- zooming "font + 100" %  (was "font + 150" %)
- "reinvented" {\rm text} 
- removed declaration from <math></math> tag (it is already present in page)
- added config.c / mathml.c variable "disable_zoom" (used -for example- in dynapi3.phtml)
- restored declaration  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"></math> tag
  we have to look into this closer !
- small change in ERROR (no printing to stderror)
- mathml.c : clean exit after ERROR (...) 
- wims_mathml.l : removed unused code of mine 4*x -> 4x .This is done by wims.cgi
  will soon try to clean more :  remove all non-wims code (remove all unused itex2mml specific code)
- corrected stupid typo error { n \choose k } : free $3 was not possible (should be $4 !)
- corrected wrong n-th root display \root{3} \of{ 2^{456} }
  the "\of" is now ignored : 2^{456} will now be under root-flag
  other way of writing: \root{3}{2^{456}}
- added
"\\longmapsto" {yylval = wims_mathml_copy_string("&#x27FC"); return MOL;}
"\\Longmapsfrom" {yylval = wims_mathml_copy_string("&#x27FD"); return MOL;}
"\\Longmapsto" {yylval = wims_mathml_copy_string("&#x27FE"); return MOL;}
- 20/9/2012 added 
"\\large" { yylval=wims_mathml_copy_string("150%");wims_mathml_env_start = 1; return TMP_FONTSIZE;}
"\\Large" { yylval=wims_mathml_copy_string("180%");wims_mathml_env_start = 1; return TMP_FONTSIZE;}
"\\huge"  { yylval=wims_mathml_copy_string("220%");wims_mathml_env_start = 1; return TMP_FONTSIZE;}
"\\Huge"  { yylval=wims_mathml_copy_string("260%");wims_mathml_env_start = 1; return TMP_FONTSIZE;}

-26/9/2012 added forgotten "^+-=" to recognisable "text value" in inputfield in \input{size}{id}{style}{value}{readonly}
  a {value} like "{10^3 - 10^2 = 9*10^2}" will be processed normally.

-5/11/2012 added "\cline{}" as empty command. 
    \cline{2-5} will now be ignored and not interpreted as "text"
    the horizontal line in matrix can be imitated by \begin{array}{c.c.c.c-c.}
    meaning a horizontal line under the 4-th row
    This non-latex syntax "{c.c.c.c-c.}" will be ignored in math-with-gifs
-7/11/2012
    replace non-unique id="wims_mathml" by a unique id="wims_mathml..."
