Use in the wims directory:

Launch the command
wimstest/test.sh
It creates files in the directory wimstest/tmp that
should be compared with the results (which are in the svn)
in wimstest/
Check if there is a behaviour change (do not change the svn
file in the directory wimstest/dirres, if you don't
understand the change). If you have added a
test and that it is OK, change wimstest/dirres in the svn.

If you want to test only a special command.
There is three types of tests.

-- For tests in wimstest/dirtest
src/wims test /Users/perrinriou/wims/wimstest/dirtest [file] vartest

replace [file] by the name of the file in wimstest/dirtest
vartest is the name of the variable to examine (is defined in the file)

for example
src/wims test /Users/perrinriou/wims/wimstest/dirtest replace vartest

-- Tests in public_html/modules/moduletest/src

wimstest/tag.pl --file=[file] --out=[out]
in the script [out]=wimstest/tmp

-- Other tests (calling scripts in dirsrc)
for example :
wimstest/dirsrc/maxima.sh


-- There is other tests for OEF modules.

wimstest/OEFmodule.sh [list_modules]

without argument, all the OEF modules are check !! very long and not
yet useful.

-- To examine the files in src:
If you have compile with option --gcov
launch wimstest/gcov.h
and open gcovout/index.html in a browser.
