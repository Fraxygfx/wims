You are trying to compile WIMS as 'root'!

You should not do that. Compile as 'wims', please.

Welcome to the compilation of WIMS (WWW Interactive Multipurpose Server)!

This utility guides you interactively through the choice of options,
then launches the compilation.

To compile WIMS with default options, just press [Enter].

To customize the compilation options, type 'y' and press [Enter].
(Now you no longer need this because failure of the optional compilations
will not block the compilation of the whole.)

To abort now, press Ctrl-C.

   WIMS compile options (the letter in the bracket is the default)

1. This package includes an independent program, 'units-filter',
   which is used in physics/chemistry exercises for unit recognition.
   Its compilation requires flex.
@
 echo $n "   -- Compile units-filter (y/n)? [y] " $c
 read ans
 if [ "$ans" = "n" ] || [ "$ans" = "N" ]; then
  options="$options --without-units"
 else
  options="$options --with-units"
 fi
 cat <<@

2. This package includes an independent program, 'chemeq',
   which is used in physics/chemistry exercises for checking balancing
   conditions in chemical equations.
   Its compilation requires GNU C++ compiler and flex.
@
 echo $n "   -- Compile chemeq (y/n)? [y] " $c
 read ans
 if [ "$ans" = "n" ] || [ "$ans" = "N" ]; then
  options="$options --without-chemeq"
 else
  options="$options --with-chemeq"
 fi
 cat <<@

3. This package includes a stand-alone http server, 'wimsd',
   which is known to have compatibility problems on some architectures
@
 echo $n "   -- Compile wimsd (y/n)? [y] " $c
 read ans
 if [ "$ans" = "n" ] || [ "$ans" = "N" ]; then
